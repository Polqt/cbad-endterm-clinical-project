# Climan

Climan is a streamlined clinic management system developed as an end-term project for the **Cloud-Based Applications Development** course. The system is designed to help clinic staff manage patient records efficiently and allow clients to access their medical history. 

## Project Team

Developed by **Team Nyx**:
- Mahandog
- Gamboa
- Santia
- Hidalgo

Instructor: Mr. Mapa

## Project Overview

The system has two main interfaces:

1. **Admin Side**: For clinic administrators or secretaries, allowing them to manage patient records, register clients, and handle client login.
2. **Client Side**: For patients, allowing them to view their check-up details and medical history.

## Features

### Admin Side

Admins have access to the following functionalities:

- **Manage Patients**: Admins can add, view, update, and manage patient records, storing essential details about each patient.
- **Patient Registration**: Admins can register new patients, capturing details like name, age, gender, and initial check-up date.
- **Login Management**: Admins have their own login portal for secure access to the system.
- **Detailed Record Keeping**: Stores each patientâ€™s essential medical information, including:
  - **Name**
  - **Age**
  - **Gender**
  - **Diagnosis/Disease**
  - **Prescribed Medication**
  - **Check-up Date**

- **Admin Profile**: Allows admin to view there credentials and profile.

### Client Side

Clients (patients) can access the following features:

- **Login**: Clients can log in to view their records securely.
- **Medical History**: Access to a history of check-ups, including past diagnoses, treatments, and prescriptions.
- **Registration (Admin-Only)**: While clients cannot register directly, admins can register clients in the system, granting them access to the client portal.
- **Client Profile**: Allows client to view there credentials and profile.

## Tech Stack

The system is developed using:

- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of web pages.
- **CSS**: To style and enhance the appearance of the UI.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and layout consistency.
- **PHP**: For server-side scripting, managing CRUD operations, and handling user authentication.

## System Workflow

- **Client Workflow**:
  - Clients can log in to access their check-up details and history but cannot modify any records.
  - Each check-up record includes the diagnosis, prescription, and check-up date, making it easy for clients to review past visits.

- **Admin Workflow**:
  - Admins are responsible for managing all patient information.
  - They can register new patients and assign login credentials for them.
  - Admins can update patient records as needed, ensuring that medical information is accurate and up to date.
  - The admin portal allows secure login, patient registration, and the ability to edit patient information such as name, age, gender, diagnosis, prescriptions, and dates of check-up.
